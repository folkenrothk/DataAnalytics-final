# Introduction and Question

  As Ash Ketchum says, "I choose you!" (Pokémon the Movie, 2017). For over twenty years, Pokémon is an expansive gaming series from Nintendo in which players get to catch, choose, and duel with these animalistic creatures called Pokémon.  The first games were debuted as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red in Japan in 1996 (Britannica, 2020). By 2020, Pokémon has developed into a full franchise with a card game, merchandise, television shows, and multiple movies. One of it's most trendsetting games has been the mobile app Pokémon Go! which includes features using augmented reality and geocaching. Throughout all the variations of gameplay, the franchise has developed a large fanbase. Many fanatics of Pokémon often strive for the best Pokémon to create an undefeatable team.

  From all of our data, we have reached the conclusion that there are some correlations. Using this data in practice, players will still need to create teams with all kinds and levels of Pokémon to be successful. As from their iconic tagline and our data also shows that players really "Gotta catch 'em all."
