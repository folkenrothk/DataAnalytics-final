Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for the lab of this course.

## Objectives
The final project invites you to employ the methods explored in this course to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a real-world data set. You will select an application area and exploratory questions that are of interest to you, find an appropriate data set, conduct an in-depth analysis of this data set, and examine your findings in the context of the application area and your exploratory questions while keeping in mind the issues of ethics, privacy, and power dynamics. During the analysis process you will carry out the steps of data collection, cleaning and transformation (as necessary), wrangling and modeling, if necessary, and visualization to be able to tell a story from your data, as noted in Figure 1. Note: This project should contain the same amount of work as about three labs and will not include a presentation.

## Testing your programs
Please be sure to include all *working code* in with your rStudio script file with your submission. Be sure that your script is able to compute all variables necessary  in and of itself for your work without failure. In other words, sometimes one may enter code to create variables which has not been recorded in a script file and if this vital code is omitted from your script file then your program will crash. Please ensure that all necessary code to your project is correctly entered into a script file to be able to simply run it and re-create all analysis, variables, models and plots automatically.

## GatorGrader
There is no GatorGrader requirement for this work.


## Assistance
If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk with either the course instructor or a tech-leader during the lab session. You can also schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.
