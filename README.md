## Original Project Objective

The final project invites you to employ the methods explored in this course to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a real-world data set. You will select an application area and exploratory questions that are of interest to you, find an appropriate data set, conduct an in-depth analysis of this data set, and examine your findings in the context of the application area and your exploratory questions while keeping in mind the issues of ethics, privacy, and power dynamics. During the analysis process you will carry out the steps of data collection, cleaning and transformation (as necessary), wrangling and modeling, if necessary, and visualization to be able to tell a story from your data, as noted in Figure 1. Note: This project should contain the same amount of work as about three labs and will not include a presentation.


## Project Overview

As Ash Ketchum says, "I choose you!" (Yuyama, 2017). For over twenty years, Pokémon is an expansive gaming series from Nintendo in which players act as "Pokémon trainers" that get to catch, choose, and duel with these animalistic creatures called Pokémon. Pokémon is based on the story of Ash Ketchum, a ten year old boy, striving to be the best Pokémon trainer in the world (Buchanan & Burts, 2007) which acts as a guide to the storyline across the franchise. The first video games were debuted as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red in Japan in 1996 (Britannica, 2020). By 2020, Pokémon has developed into a full franchise with a card game, merchandise, television shows, and multiple movies (Assunção, et al., 2017). One of it's most trendsetting games has been the mobile app Pokémon Go! which includes features using augmented reality and geocaching. Throughout all the variations of gameplay, the franchise has developed a large fanbase. Many fanatics of Pokémon often strive for the best Pokémon to create an undefeatable team. Things fans consider on this game are the statistics of their Pokémon like their heart points (HP), attack strength, defense strength, type, etc. Some fans also question the possibility to predict Pokémon types based off of a few statistics suggesting specific weak or strong types of Pokémon. Lastly, fans wonder if they truly have to collect all of the Pokémon. Our research is aimed at these types of questions along with ones about the design of the game, is Pokémon a balanced game?
